Google Sheet Manager App: WIP

1. If you are person who uses excel sheet extensively to manage your resources. This app will be of great help to you to manage the excel sheet content from the app, reducing the trouble of opening your laptop and making an entry.
2. For now the spreadsheet link is hardcoded and data is inserted/fetched from there. Will update it to creating custom sheet and custom data entry based on user needs.
